# TerminalInvaders
This was my first project created in C++ with a team, carried out in the first year of my CS degree (2022/2023)

To compile the source codes, do this command in the directory

```
make
```
This will create an executable file, named "TerminalInvaders".

Double click on it, or ./TerminalInvaders to play the game.
